#Abstract
High blood pressure (hypertension) is a serious medical condition that will cause many complications and also impacts a large proportion of people in the world. In this paper, it’s conclude that age, gender, weight and poverty level are 4 important causes for high blood pressure via multilevel regression modelling. Moreover, predicted that there are about 33.51% adults are potentially having high blood pressure in the USA.

#Key words
High blood pressure, hypertension, Post-stratification, Logistics model, USA, Multilevel Regression Model


#Introduction

High blood pressure (hypertension) is a serious medical condition that is even more dangerous than heart disease. It can quickly damage organs and bodies even before symptoms appear, which cause difficulties for patients to realize. ()Hence, it is very important to figure out what reasons will potentially cause high blood pressure so that people will be able to have a test if it’s necessary. Moreover, many complications of hypertension will cause damage to the heart, the brain, the kidneys, the eyes and many other organs all over the body. According to WHO report, ‘In 2015, 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women had hypertension. (WHO, 2019)’  Also, ‘Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide. (WHO, 2019)’ Hypertension is very dangerous, which impacts a large proportion of people in the world.  Overall, it is crucial to predict the probability of having high blood pressure nationally so that the government can have better control.

In this paper, the prediction is specifically focus on population and surveys of USA, since data sources are feasible and reliable. However, according to data from American Heart Association’s, the newest update was in 2013 and used data from 2007 to 2010. Hence, it is meaningful to make new pretiction with newest data for update. In order to achieve this goal, the paper will use meaningful variable to build a model so that we can get the probability of having high blood pressure for American individuals. In that case, it will be easy to see which groups of people are potentially with high risk, and finally predict the propotion of people with high blood pressure in the US.

According to Lancet report, there are many reasons which will potencially cause the high blood pressure including age, gender, stress weight and other aspects. According to WHO report, income is also an important cause, because almost “two-thirds of patients living in low and low- income countries”. (WHO, 2019) These apspects will be considered in the process of data resources searching.
Overal, the NHANES and IPUMS will be used for later analysis. In the Methodology section (Section 2) will talk about the model which is used to show the relationship between blood pressure and other aspects. Moreover, the results section (Section 3) will show a detailed analysis about each aspect, and predict the proportion of people with high blood pressure.  Conclusion section (Section 4) will be about overall analysis and weakness discussion. 

#Methodology

###Data

The survey data used is the National Health and Nutrition Examinations from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This survey is designed to interview many aspects for individual health includes demographic and other health-related questions. It has long history since 1970s. The target population for this survey is the total noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population residing in the 50 states
and District of Columbia. The data we used in this paper is the data from 2011 to 2012 specifically, since it has the important outcome (Combined systolic blood pressure reading). This data its self is easily accessible in R package (‘NHANES’), and we select 16 highly relative variables according to WHO guidelines from total 32 variables. All variables will be listed in Table 1. This data is picked be cause US is a multi-culture country with a large population. Generally, samples are sufficient with various backgrounds. This data is reliable and representative even for worldwide using. This data will be used to build a model in later steps.

Table1\newline

The census data used is U.S. census data for Social Economic and Health research from IPUM’s collection, and samples are cluster samples. All the samples are also stratified by key characteristics. They are samples of households or dwellings, and we picked individual information from these large units. In order to match variables in the model, I selected variable which are highly matching to the survey data, like age, gender, weight, household income etc. This data was rearranged so that the format for each variable exactly matches the survey data. This data will be used to estimate the proportion of people with high blood pressure, since the census data can widely represent the whole country.

In order to build Multilevel regression model (MRP), I filtered data roughly before the modelling. For example, we just consider adults’ high blood pressure issue here, thus samples below 21 years old will be deducted. Also, according to Health line report, we set 130 mm Hg as the boundary. In other words, for individuals with above 130 mm Hg combined systolic blood pressure reading will be considered as high blood pressure group. In this data, we set 1 as high blood pressure results, and 0 for otherwise. Please note, different institutions have different ideas about the standard of high blood pressure, in this paper, we used the newest guideline standard.



###Model

In order to find the possibility for an individual to have high blood pressure. We will build a logistics regression Model to find the relationship between probability and other aspects. In this paper, we used R language to achieve this logistics modelling. As mentioned before, we set numerical number ‘1’ to represent the person has high blood pressure, and ‘0’ for other cases.

Model Check
Firstly, we will use all 16 variables which we pre selected before according to the WHO report to build a logistics regression. However, according to results, we only find few variables are very significant. In this case, we used step forward method for variable selection according to their P-values (a value to test weather variables are significant). Overall, we obtained 4 significant variables which are Age, Gender, Poverty and BMI. All these variables with around 850 AIC value, which are much smaller than prior original model. However, we do not have height data in census data, so we used variable weight instead. (BMI is Body mass index, weight/height in kg/m2)

Model Specific
According to that we divided variables into with different levels, and built the multilevel regression model (MRP) which shows below. (The process of level division will be explained in Post-stratification section)

$$ log(\frac{p}{1-p})= \beta_0+\beta_1  x_{agegroup31 to 40} + \beta_2 x_{agegroup41 to 50} + \beta_3 x_{agegroup31 to 40} + ... + \beta_{15} x_{Povertylevel5}$$

P in the left hand of the equation stands for the probability of a random person who potentially have high blood pressure. We broke numerical variables into several levels, thus for all 15 Xs (variables with notations) here are dummy variable. For example, the variable Xage_group31 to 40 represents that if a random individual from samples is from 31 to 40 years old, then the value of the term “X age_group31 to 40” would be 1. Otherwise, it would be zero. The same logic applies to all dummy variables X.
B0(0.29005) is the intercept here, it represents the log odds if hold all other variables be 0. In other words, if a random female who is between 21 to 30 years old, with 50 to 60 kg weight and whose household income is below the poverty in the US, then the odds for her to have high blood pressure is 33.6%
B1 to B15 (detailed results will be listed in Table2) represent coefficients in our equation, which shows how much different aspects will impact to the probability of having high blood pressure. For instance, if a female with 50 to 60 kg weight is aged from 31 to 40, the odds for her to have high blood pressure will increase by 1.28 times. Same idea for all B values here.

Post-stratification
As mentioned before, we selected 5 variables according to their p-values, and would build a logistics regression. However, in order to make census data fit in the model for prediction, we should divide these numerical variables into different level and build a multilevel regression model (MRP). For variable gender is categorical for two levels already (male and female). For age group division, we referred the age analysis by American Heart Association, and slip into 6 groups. Wight and poverty were also divided accordingly. The poverty level is the ratio of household income dividing by poverty guideline (use the standard in 2019). 1 represents the lowest income category which is below 
Then, we selected the same 4 variables from American census data and did the same level split. Overall, we obtained 360 cells in census data, and we used them to predicted the probability for each cell (group of people). Finally, we would summarize for an overall probability prediction.


###Result
After variable selection, we used variable age groups, weight, poverty level, gender and built the multilevel regression model with 16 B value. Each B value shows different impact level towards the probability. All B value were listed in Table 2.

Table 2 \newline

After doing post-stratification analysis, we estimated the probability for each cell. In other words, we estimated the probability of having high blood pressure for each distinct group of people. In Table 3, we selected 5 groups with highest probability.

Table 3\newline

Overall, we summarized all estimates together, and obtained the result 0.3351. It means that we predicted that there are about 33.51% adults are potentially having high blood pressure in the USA.

#Discussion
###Summary 
Overall, we used survey data from NHANES 2012 to build a multilevel regression model. After we set the high blood pressure standard is over for 130 mm Hg combined systolic blood pressure reading, we select 4 variables according to their P-values and AIC values. In other words, we found that age, gender, weight and poverty level are 4 important causes for high blood pressure. Then we divided each variable to several levels according to health report suggestion, and built multilevel regression model. After post-stratification analysis, we split the USA 2019 census data into 360 cells according to levels in prior survey data. We estimated the probability for each cell, and found 5 groups with highest probability. Finally, we summarized the overall probability according to numbers in each cell. I would be able to conclude that there are about 33.51% adults are potentially having high blood pressure in the USA in 2019.

###Conclusions
According to Post-stratification above, causes of high blood pressure are related to age, gender, weight and poverty. If a male is over 70 whose household income is below the poverty line, the odds for him to have high blood pressure will increase by 4.22 times. Overall, according to the B value in Table 2, we can find that elder man will have higher probability to have high blood pressure. For people whose weight is from 50 to 60 kg and household income is below the poverty line (the meaning of poverty level 1), they also have higher probability to have high blood pressure. Hence, it is important for elder people specially for those who are below the poverty line to take body examination regularly, because the have high risk to have high blood pressure. For the government, it is also important to spend more expense to care more about elder people and people below the poverty line since they are highly risky. 
According to the Table 3, all top 5 highest risk groups are aged 70 above male, and all the top 3 are below the poverty line. It is a strong evidence to declare that the risk of having high blood pressure will significantly increase as people get older. It is also meaningful to explore what reasons might cause male have higher risk than women. It it because of physical difference by genders or other personal reasons like smoking. It is also important to notice that poverty will also bring other complications like high blood pressure. This phenomenon also confirms that most of high blood pressure patients are from low and mid-income counties (the statement by WHO). 
Overall, we can conclude that there are about 33.51% adults are potentially having high blood pressure in the USA in 2019. This data is very close to the prediction by American Heart Association in 2010. It means the proportion of high blood pressure patients does not decline, instead shows a slightly increasing in recent years. There is still a long way to go to achieve the decreasing goal by WHO.

###Weakness

*Even though the census data in the USA is relatively representative for worldwide application, since American is a multicultural country with people from different races background, it is still biased to represent universally especially because the US is a developed country. 

*Even though this is the newest survey data compared to American Heart Association’s report, this the survey data is from 2012, which is still a bit far away to predict results with census data 2019.
According to WHO report, genetic problems is also a main cause, but it’s not included in the survey data.

*According to P-values, we found that BMI value is more significant than weight. However, the height is not included in census data so we cannot do BMI analysis.

*The survey data doesn’t include diet summary (like high salty diet), which might also impact on the final prediction.

*High blood pressure will consider both systolic blood pressure reading and Combined diastolic blood pressure reading in real clinic condition, however, we only considered the systolic in the paper.

###Next steps
*This paper is designed for the US prediction, if it’s necessary to predict the universal probability, then more data will be needed for more countries.

*In order to improve results of this paper, it is better to obtained survey data with more variables like family disease history or diet. (But NHANES is the most widely used analysis data for high blood discussion.)

*If the newest NHANES will be updated, then use the new survey data to build the model so that the time slot will match the census data time slot (2019).

*Moreover, it is better to consider both Combined systolic blood pressure reading and Combined diastolic blood pressure reading in modelling process in following steps.
